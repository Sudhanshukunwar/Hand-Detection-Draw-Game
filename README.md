About the Project

The Hand Detection Draw Game is a browser-based project that combines frontend development with basic computer vision concepts. The main goal of this project is to explore how hand-tracking models can be integrated into web applications to create touch-free and intuitive user interactions.

When the webcam is enabled, the application detects the user’s hand and tracks finger movement. These movements are then mapped onto an HTML5 canvas, allowing the user to draw naturally in the air.

This project is created mainly for:

Learning purposes

Experimenting with AI in the browser

Showcasing skills in JavaScript and interactive UI development

🎯 Key Features

Real-time hand detection using webcam

Draw on screen using finger movement

Touchless and mouse-free interaction

Smooth and responsive drawing canvas

Runs entirely in the browser

No backend required

🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

The browser asks for webcam permission

A hand-tracking model detects the hand

Finger position is tracked continuously

Finger coordinates are mapped to the canvas

Lines are drawn as the finger moves

Everything happens in real time, directly in the browser.

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the web page

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Core logic

HTML5 Canvas – Drawing surface

Hand Tracking Library – For detecting hand and finger landmarks
